# GT Office — Dependencies

This document is the single source of truth for every external dependency the project is allowed to use. Anything not listed here must not be introduced without updating this file and receiving team approval.

Status legend:

- `✅ Used` — present in a current manifest and backed by current code or build usage
- `⏳ Planned` — retained intentionally for upcoming work, not currently present in manifests
- `❌ Unused` — retained for history/audit, not currently present in manifests and should not be reintroduced without re-approval

Scope note:

- Root `package.json` currently contains scripts only and no external npm dependencies.
- Internal workspace crates such as `gt-*` are first-party modules and are not tracked as third-party allowlist entries here.

---

## 1. Policy

- **Milestone-scoped.** Only add dependencies required for the current milestone. Speculative additions are rejected.
- **Allowlist enforced.** Dependencies not recorded in this document are not introduced. Unused or off-list dependencies are removed on discovery.
- **Record-then-add.** Every new dependency must be recorded here before it is added to `package.json` or `Cargo.toml`. The entry must include: name, version constraint, purpose, alternatives considered, and impact scope.
- **Team approval.** Before introducing any new dependency, open a proposal (issue or PR comment) and get at least one other team member to approve.
- **Bundled vs. tree-shaken.** Prefer packages that support tree-shaking or conditional imports. When a package is listed with an asterisk (`@radix-ui/*`), only the specific sub-packages actually used should be installed.
- **Deduplication.** If an existing dependency already provides the capability, do not add a new one. Before proposing a new package, verify that no current dependency can do the job.

## 4. Adding a New Dependency

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip any step.

### 4.1 Evaluate

1. **Check existing dependencies.** Verify that no currently-allowed package already provides the capability. Document which packages you considered and why they are insufficient.
2. **Assess size and maintenance.** Prefer small, well-maintained packages with minimal transitive dependencies. Check bundle size (JS) or compile time impact (Rust).
3. **Assess license compatibility.** The project uses Apache-2.0. Ensure the dependency's license is compatible (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2/3, ISC, 0BSD, etc.).

### 4.2 Record

Add an entry to the appropriate allowlist table in this document with:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Exact package or crate name |
| **Version** | Version constraint (for example `^5.3.0` or `>=1.0`) |
| **Purpose** | One-line description of what it provides and why it is needed |
| **Alternatives considered** | Which existing or candidate packages were evaluated and rejected |
| **Impact scope** | Which workspace packages or features will use it |

### 4.3 Update manifests

- **npm packages:** add to the relevant `package.json` (root or workspace package).
- **Rust crates:** add to the workspace `Cargo.toml` with appropriate feature flags when they are workspace-wide; use crate-local manifests only when the dependency is truly crate-local.

### 4.4 Verify

Run the full verification suite. All commands must pass before the dependency is considered introduced:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build:web
cargo check --workspace
```

If any command fails, resolve the failure before proceeding. Do not merge a dependency that breaks the build.

---

## 5. Removing Dependencies

When a dependency is no longer used:

1. Update its status in this document.
2. Remove it from `package.json` or `Cargo.toml` if it is no longer needed.
3. Run the verification suite above.
4. Commit the manifest change and this document update in the same commit.
